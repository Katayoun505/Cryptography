# Fundamentals of Cryptography in Python
This project demonstrates fundamental cryptographic concepts using the Python `cryptography` library. It covers symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and secure hashing.

## 📂 Project Files
* **`crypto_demo.py`**: Implementation of Symmetric encryption (Fernet/AES) and password hashing (SHA-256).
* **`hashing_sha256_assignment.py`**: Implementation of Asymmetric encryption (RSA) using public and private key pairs with OAEP padding.

## 🛠️ Requirements
You will need to install the cryptography library to run these scripts:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```
## 🚀 How to Run

After installing the requirements, you can run the scripts directly from your terminal:

1. **RSA Demo:**
   ```bash
   python hashing_sha256_assignment.py
